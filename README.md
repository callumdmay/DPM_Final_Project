# ECSE 211 "Design Principles and Methods" Final Project


The project description is as follows:

*Construct an autonomous robot capable of finding and manipulating Styrofoam blocks, 
while navigating within an enclosed area populated with known obstacles randomly placed with a 12’ x 12’ enclosure.
The task of the robot is to compete one-on-one with an opponent in a variation of the Capture the Flag game.*

Throughout the first half of the semester we spent time familiarizing ourselves with the LEJOS API and Lego Mindstorm EV3 kits
in order to develop the skills to implement the capture the flag game. The entire project is written in java, using the LEJOS library
that provides support for using the Lego Mindstorm EV3 motors and sensors in a java development environment.
